{-| The "s-cargot" library attempts to be as general as possible, and
    to support a wide range of use-cases for s-expressions. It is built
    around a core of primitives which are then exposed in various
    ways, and can be easily and flexibly extended. This tutorial
    describes particular use-cases, and then shows how to adapt this
    library to that use-case.
