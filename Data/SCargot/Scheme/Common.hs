module Data.SCargot.Scheme.Common where

-- Schemes are actually kind of complicated! The goal is to support
-- R[34567]RS pretty fully, and I'm actually 100% happy to try to
-- add R[12]RS support, as well, but that might actually involve
-- hunting down physical copies of the relevant reports.

-- R3RS is dedicated to the memory of Algol-60, so I might have
-- to dedicate this to the memory of R(<6)RS.
